## Overview

ðŸŒº UkuleleWeb is a minimalist Markdown-based wiki loosely based on the design of the original WikiWikiWeb.

Original Launch announcement:

> Got frustrated with overkill wiki software and built my own WikiWikiWeb clone [https://t.co/kXEUVqWieQ](https://github.com/gnoack/ukuleleweb) (< 400 LoC of Go, 3 dependencies, syntax is markdown with CamelCaseWikiLinks, 2 shell commands to install and run it). I'm using it daily for the past 2 weeks.

## Features

UkuleleWeb suppports a small set of features on top:

* Syntax
  * **Markdown syntax** for wiki pages
  * **Shortlinks** prefixed with "go/": go/wiki
  * **Diagrams in PIC syntax** with GoPikchr
* **Slightly nicer CSS** for tables and inline code blocks
* **Backlinks** listed at the bottom of every page

Some examples: UkuleleWebSyntax

## Non-features

UkuleleWeb is opinionated and minimal.

Instead of adding many features to UkuleleWeb itself,
UkuleleWeb exposes its internals so that they are easy to manipulate and extend.
A variety of things can be done in reverse proxies,
and pages are stored as plain files on disk for easy manipulation.
Each file is named like a wiki page and stores that page's Markdown source.

Feature              | How to implement it
---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------
Theming              | Override the CSS in a reverse proxy (UkuleleWebTheming)
User Authentication  | Implement it in a reverse proxy
Wiki page versioning | Use common version control software or file system features on the wiki's file storage
Special wiki pages   | Can be generated with shell scripts and Unix tools into the storage directory

It is good to have fewer features,
because that means that UkuleleWeb is solid and stable.
